About this project
My goal for this project is to Analyze complaint volume across time and by product, issue, geographic area, channel Type, see how complaints are resolved, what the company response to each complaints it received from the CFPB. For that I used Pandas, Numpy, Plotly & Dash to build to create the intereactive Dashboard.

Recommended Analysis :

Do consumer complaints show any seasonal patterns?

Which products present the most complaints? What are its most common issues?

How are complaints typically resolved?

Can you learn anything from the complaints with untimely responses?

Here are my key findings :

CFPB has registred in total 62 516 Consumer complaints on financial products & services for Bank of America from 2017 to 2023.
The complaints concerns about 9 products and 46 sub-products in 52 US states.
CFPB takes about 1.22 days to send customer complaint to the relevant company from the day it received it
The timely response rate to complaints is 93.77 %
From the overall years (2017-2023), we registred more customers complaints in 2022.
We noticed a peak on the month of july, that means CFPB received the huge volume of complaints on this month.
In February we have seen a decrease of complaints around 7%, and since then it shows in increase of customers complaints until june, where it slightly decreased ( around 3%) before we noticed the peak in July. The two following month the volum of complaints shows an interesting decrease. In October, the volume rises slightly, then declines in November and and starts to rise again in December.
Most of the complaints is submitted via web, representing around 73% of the overall volume of complaints
On the products side, Checking or Savings Acount received the highest number of complaints (24814) , which could indicate issues in banking operations or customer dissatisfaction with this product. Credit Card and Prepaid Card also has a high complaints volume (16197).
On the Sub-products side, most of complaints are abount checking account (20768 complaints in total, this is around 33% of the overall volume)
Managing account is the most frequently issue reported.
The five states with the most complaints are California (CA), Florida (FL), Texas (TX), New York (NY) and Georgia (GA); with California recording the most.
In California, the higest number of complaints is recorded in 2021.
The highest average processing time (CFPB to send complaints to company) is in South Dakota (SD) (74.12 hours - more than 3 days), and the lowest is in Iowa (IA) (7.46 hours - less than one day).
California receives the most complaints, but also the most timely responses.
Most of the companies reponses to customers complaints are accompanied with explanation.
